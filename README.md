# Multimodal Mental Health Assessment System

A real-time AI-based system that assesses mental health by analyzing **facial expressions, voice patterns, and linguistic sentiment** using PHQ-9 standards.

---

##  Problem Statement
Mental health conditions often remain undiagnosed due to limited access to early screening tools. Traditional assessments rely heavily on self-reported responses. This project aims to provide an **automated, multimodal mental health assessment system** using AI techniques.

---

##  Project Type
**Team Project (Major Project)**

This project was developed as a **team-based undergraduate major project**.

###  My Contribution
My contribution to this team project included:
- Backend development using Flask
- Database integration using SQLAlchemy
- Handling assessment logic and PHQ-9 score calculation
- Integrating facial, voice, and sentiment analysis modules
- Managing real-time session flow and result storage

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Backend Framework:** Flask, Flask-SocketIO  
- **Database:** MySQL / SQLite (SQLAlchemy ORM)  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, Dlib  
- **Facial Emotion Detection:** FER, MTCNN  
- **Speech & Language Analysis:** Speech Recognition, TextBlob  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## System Workflow
1. User registration and authentication
2. Voice-interactive PHQ-9 questionnaire
3. Real-time facial expression analysis via webcam
4. Vocal emotion detection through microphone input
5. Linguistic sentiment analysis from speech transcription
6. Multimodal data aggregation
7. PHQ-9 score calculation and severity classification
8. Result storage and dashboard visualization

---

##  Results & Outcome
- Successfully implemented a **real-time multimodal mental health assessment system**
- Generated PHQ-9 scores with severity levels
- Stored and displayed assessment history
- Provided basic mental health recommendations

---

##  Future Improvements
- Integration with wearable devices for physiological data
- Cloud deployment and scalability
- Improved deep learning models for emotion recognition
- Mobile application support
